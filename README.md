## Animals Shelter
You are assigned to create a system for Animals Shelter with minimal web view where employees and volunteers
could operate. Use your favorite technology and toolset.
### 1. High-Level Requirements
#### 1.1 Authentication
Employees and volunteers should be able to see everything, but once they need to perform a write operation, they
need to be prompted to authenticate. They should have two roles - "admin" for employees and "user" for the
volunteers.
#### 1.2 View animals
Both admins and users should be able to view all animals and their availability. Eventually, they can try to get one for
a walk.
#### 1.3 Take one out for a walk
Admins/employees should be able to take a specific animal for a walk and be assigned to a volunteer.
#### 1.4 Return from a walk
Admins/employees should be able to mark animals as returned and should be able to add a comment for the
volunteer.
#### 1.5 View all animals currently on a walk
Employees should be able to see all animals that are currently on a walk and who took them
#### 1.6 My history
Users/volunteers should be able to see which animals they took on a walk for the past 3 months. Admins/employees
can see a user history and last 5 comments added for the volunteer.
#### 1.7 Add animal
Employees should be able to add an animal to the shelter.
#### 1.8 Adopt animal
Employees should be able to mark an animal as adopted and it no longer be visible in the system.
### 2. Specifics
All specifics are left to you - the visualization of the application and business specifics such as how the user chooses
animals.
### 3. Technical Requirements
#### 3.1 Application type
The project has to be a web application.
#### 3.2 Persistent storage
The application should rely on persistent storage rather than process' allocated memory.
### 4. Remarks
It is important for the application to work, but it's more important to work in teams with a structured process and
good communication. You might be asked more about the soft part of the implementation rather than the technical
one.
